## About

### What is deployKF?

deployKF is the best way to build reliable ML Platforms on Kubernetes.

- deployKF supports leading [MLOps & Data tools](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/tools/) from both Kubeflow, and other projects
- deployKF has a Helm-like interface, with [values](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/deploykf-values/) for configuring all aspects of the deployment (no need to edit Kubernetes YAML)
- deployKF does NOT install resources directly in your cluster, instead it generates [ArgoCD Applications](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications) to provide native GitOps support

### What AI/ML tools are in deployKF?

Currently, deployKF supports MLOps tools from the Kubeflow ecosystem like [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/tools/#kubeflow-pipelines) and [Kubeflow Notebooks](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/tools/#kubeflow-notebooks).
We are actively adding support for other popular tools such as [MLFlow (Model Registry)](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/future-tools/#mlflow-model-registry), [Apache Airflow](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/future-tools/#apache-airflow), and [Feast](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/future-tools/#feast). 

For more information, please see [supported tools](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/tools/) and [future tools](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/future-tools/)!

### Is commercial support available for deployKF?

The creator of deployKF (Mathew Wicks), operates a US-based MLOps company called [Aranui Solutions](https://www.aranui.solutions) that provides commercial support and consulting for deployKF.

Connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathewwicks/) or email [`sales@aranui.solutions`](mailto:sales@aranui.solutions?subject=%5BdeployKF%5D%20MY_SUBJECT) to learn more!

### Who uses deployKF?

deployKF is a new project, and we are still building our community.

Please consider adding your organization to our [list of adopters](ADOPTERS.md).

### What is the difference between Kubeflow and deployKF?

Kubeflow and deployKF are two different but related projects:

- deployKF is a tool for deploying Kubeflow and other MLOps tools on Kubernetes as a cohesive platform.
- Kubeflow is a project that develops MLOps tools, including Kubeflow Pipelines, Kubeflow Notebooks, Katib, and more.

For more details, see our detailed [deployKF vs Kubeflow](https://www.deploykf.org/about/kubeflow-vs-deploykf/) comparison.

### Do you have a Slack or Mailing List?

Yes! For more information please see our [community page](https://www.deploykf.org/about/community/).
